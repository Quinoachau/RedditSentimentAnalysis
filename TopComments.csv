This is amazing 10/10
"Thank you everyone, seems like it is all lovely positive feedback. 

While I know the general premise of the game I thought it would be best to check with the experts. 😊. You all get up votes."
"Yes absolutely so cute, good job, the best, have an Oscar, a Nobel prize, omfg yes why are you asking it's offensive yes it's perfect if your kid doesn't like it punch him, the law can make exceptions, its perfect, best dad ever."
Great parent award to you
"This is so sweet, and yes it looks great"
"It's missing a player aiming at his feet and hitting headshots, and another one just spinning really fast.

Jokes aside (it was a reference to the prevalence of cheaters in the game), I love the picture! It's perfect"
I wish you were my parent
This is awesome!
This is so sick!
"This is
1. Adorable
2. A great representation of the game
3. Artistically sound
4. A great card im sure they will love"
"Awesome job, I’d cry if my dad did this for me instead of yelling at me for playing more than 60 minutes in 1 day"
This gets my vote to go viral. Down to the noob shooting the sky at the bottom. 10/10.
If your kid doesn't love this put them up for adoption because they don't deserve you.
This is so creative and cool well done parent.
"DAMNNN, I WISH AOMEONE GIVE ME THIS IN MY BIRTHDAY, lucky guy fr 10/10"
"it looks amazing, not a perfect representation but looking awesome"
It’s amazing!
Needs a few spin botters tho
This should be in an art museum
10/10 execution on a fantastic idea
W parent
I think you ve nailed it
"Bro this is amazing, the chaos that's happening here still occurs today"
You sure made an accurate portrayal for someone who never played the game 😂 good job 10/10
This if fucking awesome. I would be over the moon receiving that
***yes***
"you get poty, parent of the year"
Looks great mate ❤️
10/10
I love this so much
">I've never played the game


You're a fucking menace."
"![img](avatar_exp|82243973|starstruck)

Dassss whyyy hesss theee goaatttt , theeee goattttttttt"
It gets better and better the more i see it
"Its an amazing representation, and you're an even more amazing parent"
"This is so nice, happy birthday! You are a great father!"
"W parent, hope your kid appreciates what a legend you are"
"this is lovely from you, Happy Birthday for your kid😇"
Parent of the year award. Damn
"Wait, have you actually seen the game because you basically made a perfect recreation of bombsite A on dust 2, I love it though, it's amazing 10/10"
Perfect ! Good job daddy
"Looking at this card I’m not sure I believe you when you say you’ve never played CS. This is very accurate, great job"
Thats awesome man 👌
This is PERFECT and TOTALLY AWESOME!
The only negative thing about this is I can’t buy a print of that artwork.
That’s a *great* representation. You’re so sweet
This is so fantastic
You mixed characters with the Tf2 Scout and Pyro but I think those are very cute additions. You did really well! Proud of you kind sir/lady
"The backstab is just so good, and how the guy stabbing is getting shocked... That really is part of the gameplay, happened to me some days ago LMAO. I love it"
"Only thing missing is a 13 year old screaming racist remarks, but I understand why you wouldn’t want to put that on a birthday card 🤣🤣"
"If this is modeled after dust 2 the staircase is a unnecessary extra.... but tbh I don't mind. 10/10 birthday card I like the palm tree vibes :) you even got some of the little details right, gas mask CT and typical cross smoke. Even the classic dust 2 type wooden door in the background🥰

Don't lie to us with this much detail and the little extras you probably have played the game.... 1.6 is also cs 👀
If not you are probably a really good father :) the detail and love you put into this shows how much you care. 

Either way much love <3"
Not enough angry russians but a great card.
Maybe he plays it on his Xbox account hahah
"If you say yes he will send you a ""Tournament"" link. Common scam."
"If you're smart enough to check if he has CS (or notice he doesn't) then you're not someone they want to waste time on anyways.

Same reason scams by mail, phone, or whatever, will always be written with obvious mistakes and clues throughout. If you're smart enough to see those, you're probably not stupid enough to follow through the rest of the sscam anyway."
🤣
I always troll this mfrs yes give me a minute and then but there is a problem with login and I pretending retard and I asking some personal questions about how is your kids doing or family or why he not call me but just text me. And they always give up.
report the scammer please
TŁUSTA MASZYNA
It’s crazy. They cant even be arsed putting together a believable scam
"Very common scam, happens once a week for me regarding team fortress 2 teams"
Literally said bro to someone that tries to scam you xD
good catch
[deleted]
I would say its a stolen account which is now used as a bot
Cool one bro
Oldest one in the book
how did this scam even start? did people use to take ransoms into tournaments when someone didn't show up? lol
I always play along and waste their time
"Nono, he’s right. Got a tournament link and everything. The entry fee is your inventory though"
Repostio
If you enter with this mindset you already lost. Better play some offline games.
I thought it was my turn to repost this..
It’s more like a “find a cheater to take your rank”
I miss playing train and cache
"No it's more like: u have skill issue, you're about to loose your rank and blame youre teammates"
So he saying go mid to catwalk?
Grayhound is now a defunct org
"I was looking at putting a bunch of my stuff on the market to downsize my inventory and noticed some of my seemingly basic stuff has gone up, this sticker in particular.  


If anyone knows why that info would be greatly appreciated and if there is a better place to discuss and ask about price changes in the CS market i'd love to know."
The Org folded after failing to qualify for the major. So basically there isn’t going to be anymore Greyhound sticker and scarcity is rarity ya know.
"Everyone is saying they’re no longer an organization and shut down due to not qualifying for the major… but they still have two upcoming events, even one at intel?

The logo is still not looking good even with the new one.
I beleve they did not qualify for the mayor so no new stickers for that team
"Idk I used to scratch them for ""good luck"" while streaming"
r/comedyarchaeology
Interesting 😂
Yes but i'm also drooling
and you shoot from your eyes
that's a bot
I mean duh
Most of us knew this
"Ye, becouse other fps are different"
This would make scoping with the awp pretty painful
"On steam only Total Spent 17032,57€"
"$10

I just continually recycle that money. I'm now sitting at a $15 dollar inventory. Someday ill get to a knife...

How you could ever spend over 1k is beyond me. But hey, its your money."
2.5 bucks
"about 5$, and ill never put a cent more"
"$5,731.44 since 2013..."
Unfortunately 8x that
$6342.00 spent.
10€. It's ironic because when I was younger I had no money for skins and I was relatively mad about it. Now I have money to spend on the game and I want to get a knife but I don't want to put a cent on it until they improve it in many ways.
"You have spent approximately $1,618.89 USD in the game after this card set was released."
"2.05€ 

bought a single storage unit to put some cases in.

Bought a few skins tho but that doesn't show up there."
Zero
Like 20$ since i bought csgo in 2012
628 usd and still using stock knife and gloves
Rookie numbers
$1552… yeah me thinks I’m good for now
30 doubloons
"3200 on dota 2, 995 on cs"
Like $50
A kidney...
750 and all I got was a lousy Legion of Anubis. Only  that one red and I'm 100% sure I could count all pinks on one hand. Probably more like 3 tbh.
0 $
105 usd damn
$40 but my inventory is worth over $5000 :O
"TF2 - $14,343.58 USD

CS:GO - $16,125.01 USD

Rip CS:GO Keys :/"
sick
I do this on the same spot frequently!
insane
One guy quit in 4th round and we surrendered. 4 spinbots vs 1 in our team. Now 4/4 games cheaters involved
It’s always ancient Anubis banned first and a final decision between mirage and fkn mirage
Interesting maps!
Unranked to valve is either silver or faceit 10
Literally unplayable
Yeah sick and tired of same map all the time…
"-Mirage 

+cache (the old nongreen version)"
