# RedditSentimentAnalysis

This is a little project I made that uses reddit PRAW to sort through subreddits and get comments from different subreddits. I used the comments I got from PRAW and ran it through a sentiment analysis setting to determine if it's a negative or positive comments.

My original goal was to make it so that I could tell which communitiy was the most unhappy or happy because surely the people who are unhappy or more liekly to be the ones hating. I have determined though that the sentiment analysis pack has a hard time determining slang within the reddit posts, comments that have things like "sick" are regarded as negative even though it might say "This drawing is sick, I would love to be your kid".


Anayways, if you want to try it and change subreddits or time frames where your grabs posts and comments from you can change the 'day' to 'week' , ' month' , 'year' 'all' you can change which subreddit you want to scrape by going to main and chnaging the setSubreddit to whatever subreddit you want to check.
